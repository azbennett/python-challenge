Week 3 Challenge - Steve Bennett

You will find 2 sub folders - one for each assignment.

PyBank and PyPoll

Within each will be an 'Analysis' folder containing the output text file.
Also you'll see a 'Resources' folder with the data csv file.
Finally you'll find the main.py which is the python code for each assigment task.

Thank you!
